# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

EverythingAI is a documentation repository for comprehensive AI knowledge. It contains no executable code, build system, or tests. All content is organized as documentation files.

## Repository Structure

Documentation is organized into 7 numbered sections under `docs/`:

- **01-AI 通识** — AI fundamentals and literacy
- **02-设计篇** — Design principles for AI
- **03-产品篇** — AI product development
- **04-开发篇** — AI engineering and development
- **05-测试篇** — AI testing methodologies
- **06-通用篇** — General/cross-cutting AI topics

## Conventions

- Section directories use numbered prefixes (e.g., `01-`, `02-`) to maintain ordering.
- Directory names use Chinese to describe section themes.
- Documentation files should be placed in the appropriate thematic section.
